# Graph generator
Generates 2D graphs from the table of experiment results. Reads the table with *csv* format using *pandas* library. <br />
The *y* axis for one graph is Runtime and for another is Frames. The *x* axis can be any other hyper-parameters used for model generation. The selsected hyper-parameter for the *x* axis should be sorted using *pandas* <br />
Graphs with different *x* axises are generated.
