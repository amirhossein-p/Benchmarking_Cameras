# Benchmarking Cameras
Codes related to Benchmarking machine vision cameras. <br />
Model generator code uses Keras and crates a range of CNN models based on given hyper-parameters. <br />
Hyper-parameters for Conv2d models:
* Blocks
* Filters
* Images
* Outputs

Hyper-parameters for DepthwiseConv2d models:
* Blocks
* Images
* Outputs

There is also a possibility to create fully connected models.
Converter code creates *tflite* and *kmodel* files for each *h5* file that is generated by the model generator. Files with *tflite* format are used for **JeVois** smart camera, and files with *kmodel* format are used for **Sipeed Maix Bit** smart camera. <br />
In order to convert to *kmodel*, a library called **nncase** is used. This library is provided by Kendryte, the manufacturer of the chip used in Sipeed camera. <br />

JeVois smart camera: http://jevois.org/ <br />
Sipeed Msix Bit smart camera: https://www.seeedstudio.com/sipeed <br />
The final results of converted models with some hyper-parameters are also added. <br />
JeVois Model Changer code is just a simple script in order to easily switch to the next model when performing the experiment with JeVois camera. <br />
Graph Generator codes are used to visualize the data after testing all models on the cameras.
